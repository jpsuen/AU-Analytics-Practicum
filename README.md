This GitHub repo will act as a file repository maintained for the Spring 2017 Practicums.

Current files:
  - Model Package - Spring 2017.R
    - Provides a shiny output that allows the viewing of charts and summary statistics for the project data set.


To Use:

  1. Download the data set from Jeff via Dropbox
  2. Set the PATH_TO_DATA variable to the exact location of the downloaded file.  Examples are shown for CSV, XLSX, and SAS data exports.
    - Note: XLSX data takes a significantly longer time to load than SAS, CSV, or TXT files
  3. Run the full data set.  It is particularly important that you check for errors when installing new packages.  The application will not function correctly if data is incorrect.
  4. If all packages install correctly and the software runs without any issues you should see a new window pop up in either R or your default browser.
